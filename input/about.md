Title: About
---

My name is Kamran Ayub. I'm a professional developer that works in Minneapolis, MN
and have been in the industry since 2006.

I am what is fondly called a "full stack" developer which means I specialize in front-end design 
*and* back-end development using languages like C#, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. 
Additionally, I also have experience in system administration maintaining server infrastructure
on-prem, in the cloud (in Azure and AWS), and writing automation using PowerShell.

In my spare time, I run the website [Keep Track of My Games](http://ktomg.com),
I contribute to [Excalibur.js](http://excaliburjs.com), and [many other small projects](http://github.com/kamranayub).

*After* my spare time is used up, I [make](/projects) and 
[play](https://keeptrackofmygames.com/user/kamranicus) video games, and participate in game jams.

Oh, I also love to [travel](/travel).

**If you want to get in touch**, simply email my full name at gmail.com.

## Courses

I've published my first video course, 
[Introduction to TypeScript](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/introduction-typescript-video) with Packt Publishing.
I intend to do more video courses in the future.

## Keep Track of My Games

[Keep Track of My Games](http://ktomg.com) is a way to organize your game collection and track new
releases. I started it in 2011 and have been running it solo ever since. The application is non-commercial
because I leverage the GiantBomb game database for my data. In order to keep the site up-to-date and fast,
I have background jobs that utilize an on-prem version of the Azure Kudu console along with Azure 
Queues and Table Storage. The tech stack is ASP.NET MVC, TypeScript, and RavenDB as the backend database.

## Excalibur.js

[Excalibur.js](http://excaliburjs.com) is a web-based game engine written in TypeScript. I work with
several other talented friends on the project. The project is free and open source. We leverage heavy
automation using services like Travis CI, Appveyor, and Coveralls. The API documentation is generated
using TypeDoc and we've set up cross-repository automation to ensure the docs are 100% up-to-date with
the master branch. We use the typical GitHub Pull Request workflow to perform code reviews and ensure
that the master branch stays green and stable.
