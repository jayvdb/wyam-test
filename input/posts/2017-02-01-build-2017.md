Come May 10, I'll be heading to Seattle for the [Microsoft Build 2017](http://build.microsoft.com) conference with my good friend and co-worker, [Erik Onarheim](http://twitter.com/erikonarheim). We'll be looking forward to any talks around Windows Server containers, container orchestration, and other "DevOps" stuff related to what we do at work.

I've always enjoyed my time at Build and my wife will be joining me, she's never been to Seattle so it'll be fun for her too!
