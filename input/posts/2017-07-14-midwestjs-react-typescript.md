I'm excited to be speaking about **Building Scalable, Maintainable Apps Using TypeScript and React** at [Midwest.js](http://midwestjs.com/#/schedule) August 17, my scheduled time is 1:30pm.

Here's what to expect:

- How to design components with TypeScript and Redux
- Examples of working with interfaces and ES6 componenets in TypeScript
- Architecture patterns and organization for React apps
- Performance tuning and advice with React/Redux

The presentation will be based on my progress converting from Knockout.js to React.js for [Keep Track of My Games](http://ktomg.com). I've been doing a ton of performance tuning and have definitely learned a lot about using TypeScript with React and Redux so I'm excited to share my findings and advice. It's also a presentation based on my learning so far and where I want to go; I'm not even complete with the rewrite!

If you're attending, I hope to see you there! Don't be a stranger and say hi if you see me.
