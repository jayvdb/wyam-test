Title: Travel
---

In 2015, my wife and I spent six months in [Aix-en-Provence, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aix-en-Provence) on sabbatical--traveling around 
Europe, taking pictures, drinking cheap wine, and generally enjoying life. We created a 
travel blog under the name Aix Squared which you can read at the following links:

- [Aix Squared](https://medium.com/aix-squared)
- [Aix in Marrakech](https://medium.com/aix-in-marrakesh)
- [Aix in Amsterdam](https://medium.com/aix-in-amsterdam)
- [Aix in London](https://medium.com/aix-in-london)
- [Aix in Dublin](https://medium.com/aix-in-dublin)
- [Aix in Oslo](https://medium.com/aix-in-oslo)
- [Aix in Florence](https://medium.com/aix-in-florence)

At some point, I will compile all our photos and posts into a book. For now, you can read them on Medium.
